Arlecchino,Freminet,"You have two choices before you. You can either wallow in the past until you drown in its miseries... Or you can join hands with your 'family' and open your eyes again."
Arlecchino,Lynette,"You needn't fret, nor should you feel like you have to change your own habits. But you should know that genuine understanding can only be found, not sought. A true companion is someone who can read your 'signals.'"
Arlecchino,Lyney,"In the end, a child must grow up, and they must surpass their parents. Only thus may a family flourish. When that day comes... I look forward to hearing what 'family' means to him."
Callas,Wriothesley,"Navia, do you remember when I refused the title of 'Baron' bestowed upon me by the Palais Mermonia a few years back? Well, that's beside the point. Today, I finally met the Administrator of the Fortress of Meropide. I had always assumed that 'Duke' was simply a hollow title too... But it turns out that Wriothesley is far more worldly than he looks."
Xbalanque,Neuvillette,"Someday, when they return, their true ordeal shall begin."
Lyney,Freminet,"Did you see that? As the dove emerged from the hat, the corner of Freminet's mouth turned up very slightly. Imagine how he'd react if we could find a way to make a whole flock of them fly out! After all, as his big brother, it's my duty to make him laugh."
Freminet,Lynette,"That's already the fifth time this month... Haven't you learned not to mess with Lynette?"
Lynette,Lyney,"Sometimes it distracts with a feint, others it pretends to slip up and reveal a flaw... When things get serious, sleight of hand dazzles more than the magic itself. Can you guess what it is?"
Yae Miko,Kirara,"She's an adorable little nekomata. Just whisper 'the parcel delivery is going to be late' in her ear while she's asleep, and she'll spring right up and start dashing faster than General Gorou does on the battlefield."
Alhaitham,Kaveh,"Mainstream Sumeru academia tends to hide a certain fact from time to time, which is that for some people, talent can occasionally be more of a burden instead. Nevertheless, this view can also be but an excuse. In truth, it is your character that determines your destiny first and foremost. The aforementioned ideas are the sort that Kaveh will persistently rebut."
Qiqi,Baizhu,"Dr. Baizhu... Something is bothering him, but he won't tell me anything... He hates death, but he's always researching it... I don't understand... But that's not a problem. I know... that Dr. Baizhu is a good person."
Varka,Mika,"I recruited Mika into the expedition team to hone his combat skills. As for why he reports directly to me... Well, since Jean isn't with us, I needed someone trustworthy to deal with all the odd errands, hahaha."
Blazing Beasts,Dehya,"Sing a song, sing along, take your sitar, let's sing all day long. Sing my sword, sing my bow, sing my tattered ban-dan-oh. Fear no one, fear no lad, only fear if Dehya is mad. We love Dehya, she's beautiful and strong. Oh, our precious Dehya, we'll never do you wrong."
Madame Ping,Yaoyao,"I wanted to give Yaoyao the magical device I used when I was younger, so she could protect herself. But before I could say anything, Cloud Retainer had already gifted Yuegui to her. Can't say I'm surprised. Yaoyao is a very lovable child after all."
Kaveh,Alhaitham,"I can't deny that he's very smart. However, it's a shame that a man of such talent only pays attention to the truth itself and not to the people around him. Or perhaps this is due to an extraordinary sense of individualism, which causes a lot of problems. For example, he doesn't seem to respect his seniors... Of course, I'm not referring to myself specifically."
Quote from the book "Introduction to Ancient Machines",Faruzan,"Much of the content found within this book originates from Madam Faruzan's theories and manuscripts. It is our hope that future generations of scholars will remember her name when she returns to the Akademiya."
Nahida,Wanderer,"Those who believe cast the gods in glory, while unbelievers witness how gods transcend. But as for him, I will not characterize him as either. All uncertainties are but foundations for his future path."
A mysterious girl who calls herself "The Stars' Blessing",Layla,"She always says that she's overwhelmed writing her thesis and drawing star charts stresses her out, but she's more resilient than anyone, and refuses to fall behind... Why do I know her so well? Hehe..."
Neuvillette,Nahida,"One might say she pays too much attention or dotes on people too much... But while her actions can be flawed, I believe her sense of responsibility as Sumeru's deity to be a commendable thing. Ah, that the youngest of gods should be thus, while a certain other person, by contrast, should be so prone to hysterics..."
Dehya,Candace,"I once gave Candace some jewelry and told her to learn to enjoy life and find happiness outside of work. She replied that seeing the village in peace was enough to make her happy... Well, this guardian really has a unique way of enjoying life..."
Dori,Nilou,"What's so great about that little theater? If she went with me on tour all around Teyvat, she could earn so much Mora, more than what she could ever dream of... Alas, she's too innocent. So innocent that she knows nothing of her own worth."
Tighnari,Cyno,"Many researchers at the Akademiya fear that the General Mahamatra will interfere with their research. However, it seems that they are worrying about nothing. Most of them do not produce results worthy of his visit."
Amber,Collei,"Oh, you're going to Sumeru? Can you give my regards to Collei? Well... it's been so long, I wonder if her hair has grown out and if she's taller?"
Cyno,Tighnari,"A message for you. I brought back a specialty from the desert, two packs of honeyed dates, which helps to replenish your energy, whether in the morning or at night. Thank you for your patience in teaching and taking care of Collei. Good luck with your work and best wishes for Collei's studies."
Tighnari,Dori,"No matter how rare the experimental materials are, you can buy them from Dori. I don't know where she gets her goods from... Also, make sure you pay attention to the price when you buy from her. My heart aches every time I pay the bill."
Kamisato Ayato,Shikanoin Heizou,"Doushin Shikanoin has admirable wit and insight. While he is unfettered and unrestrained in demeanor, one should not dismiss his talents. The Tenryou Commission is incredibly fortunate to have such a man in their ranks."
Kujou Sara,Kuki Shinobu,"My apologies, I have not sent my regards for a long time. I am writing to introduce a talented person to you. She is very knowledgeable, well-versed in both literature and martial arts, and is an invaluable assistant... Unfortunately, she is currently working for the Arataki Gang and only accepts outsourced consultations, which is a pity."
Yanfei,Yelan,"Oh, you're looking for Yelan? Hmm, I'd like to suggest that you treat her as an ordinary person, but if you do, it's easy to lose control over negotiations. There are some things that really depend on her impression of you."
Thoma,Kamisato Ayato,"The game of politics is fraught with peril. Saying too little is not good, but saying too much is also bad. But don't get me wrong, my Lord does not take any joy in these 'battles.' For him, it's just... a matter of duty"
Raiden Shogun,Yae Miko,"I have witnessed the Kitsune's majesty in the moonlit forest. She has a myriad of forms, revealing the unknown and the unseen... just as how fate shines on me and the endless world."
Fan Er'ye,Yun Jin,"One performance by Yun Jin at our tea house rakes in enough Mora that we won't have to open for a whole month!"

Taroumaru,Thoma,"Thoma is very good at taking care of people and is a very good friend. But you can't just take care of others, you have to take care of yourself too..."
Aloy,Aloy,"Everything I do is in the service of life, not death. That's why I'm here with you."
Sangonomiya Kokomi,Kujou Sara,"I must admit, Kujou Sara is an opponent that cannot be taken lightly. Although we have opposing views, her loyalty and sincerity is truly admirable... I believe that in the entire city of Inazuma, she is the one with the most adoration for the Shogun."
Kitsune Saiguu,Raiden Shogun,"Her Excellency seeks to rid herself of the mundane delusions of the world, but only in an attempt to overcome the cycle of life and death. No one truly understands her, yet she does not deign to make herself understood... Her Excellency the Shogun is simply full of contradictions."
Gorou,Sangonomiya Kokomi,"Her Excellency, Sangonomiya, is an astute strategist. She can accurately predict enemy movements from thousands of miles of way. When we fought against the Shogun's army, what we lacked in manpower and weaponry, we more than made up for with Her Excellency's tactical prowess. Were it not for Her Excellency, not a single one of Watatsumi Island's victories would have been possible."
Kamisato Ayato,Sayu,"Are you in a hurry to find Sayu? Oh, I see, she is usually hiding in the trees in the afternoons. I have my own ways of finding her, so please let me know if you need help... Oh, but if I interfere, then I will deny you the pleasure of finishing this task on your own, won't I?"
An ordinary businessman from Hanamizaka,Kamisato Ayaka,"Though Miss Ayaka is the eldest daughter of the Kamisato Clan, she is very attentive to everyone's needs. She will personally take care of the most troublesome matters. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't believe that there are noble ladies like her!"
Kaedehara Kazuha,Kaedehara Kazuha,"If one's heart is empty, all under heaven is empty. But if one's heart is pure, all under heaven is pure."
Kamisato Ayaka,Yoimiya,"Fireworks are the highlight of the festival, and Yoimiya is Inazuma's best pyrotechnician. Every display she planned turns out fabulously. Ah, right, do not worry about the fire hazards. The Yashiro Commission and shrine maidens will take care of the necessary precautions so that she can fully express her creativity."
Jean,Eula,"The Knights of Favonius values one's abilities and deeds more than their background and lineage. Eula is indeed an outstanding knight, and there is no need to hold her identity as a descendant of the ancient nobles against her."
